building custom versions of REBOL, including built-in extension modules.

FEEDBACK:
---------

R3 Chat is the forum for comments, feedback, code changes, and questions.
Type "chat" at the R3 command line. Most users only need to know about
five commands. Type "help" for doc pages, and "?" for a summary.

HOW TO BUILD:
------------
A standard makefile is generated for each release and can be used for Linux,
BSD, OS X, and other Unix-like make systems. Note that if you modify any 
of the build script files you need to put an executable copy of rebol in your
build directory.

Makefiles for other toolchains (like CodeBlocks or MSVC) are not provided in
this package, but can usually be found online from members of the REBOL
community.

That's it for now. Be productive, lean, and quick,
